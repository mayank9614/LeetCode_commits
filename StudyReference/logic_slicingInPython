In Python, slicing is a way to extract a portion of a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) using a specific syntax. The syntax for slicing is:

\[
\text{{sequence}}[\text{{start}}:\text{{end}}:\text{{step}}]
\]

- The \(\text{{start}}\) index specifies where the slice starts. If omitted, it defaults to 0 for positive \(\text{{step}}\) values and -1 for negative \(\text{{step}}\) values.
- The \(\text{{end}}\) index specifies where the slice ends. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the sequence for positive \(\text{{step}}\) values and -1 for negative \(\text{{step}}\) values.
- The \(\text{{step}}\) specifies the interval between elements. If omitted, it defaults to 1.

Let's look at a few examples using strings:

```python
s = "Hello, World!"

# Slice from index 0 to 5 with a step of 1
print(s[0:5]) # Output: "Hello"

# Slice from index 7 to the end with a step of 1
print(s[7:]) # Output: "World!"

# Slice the entire string with a step of 2
print(s[::2]) # Output: "Hlo ol!"
```

In the case of the palindrome check, we used slicing to reverse the string:

```python
s = "Hello, World!"
reversed_s = s[::-1]
print(reversed_s) # Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"
```

In this example, we didn't specify the \(\text{{start}}\) and \(\text{{end}}\) indices, so they default to the entire string. We set the \(\text{{step}}\) to -1, which means we start at the end of the string and move backwards one character at a time. This effectively reverses the string.
