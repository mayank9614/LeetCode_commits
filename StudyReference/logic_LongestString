The solution to the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem primarily uses the following data structure and algorithm (DSA) concepts:

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: 
    - This is the main algorithmic concept used in the solution. The idea is to maintain a "window" of characters in the string that moves rightward. The window expands or shrinks based on certain conditions.
    - In this problem, the window (defined by the `left` and `right` pointers) expands when a new unique character is encountered and shrinks when a repeating character is found.

2. **Set (Hash Set)**:
    - A set is a data structure that stores unique elements in no particular order. 
    - In this solution, a set (`chars`) is used to keep track of characters in the current window (substring). It allows for constant time (`O(1)`) checks to see if a character is already in the current substring and for adding/removing characters.
    - The set is crucial for efficiently determining whether a character has been seen before without having to scan through the entire substring.

            Of course! Here are some links that provide explanations on the concept of a HashSet:

1. **Stack Overflow**:
   - **Description**: This discussion on Stack Overflow provides insights into what a HashSet is. A HashSet holds a set of objects in a way that allows you to easily and quickly determine whether an object is already in the set or not. It uses a hash-based implementation, making operations like Add, Remove, and Contains O(1).

2. **GeeksforGeeks**:
   - **Description**: This article from GeeksforGeeks provides a comprehensive guide on Java's HashSet class, which implements the Set interface and is backed by a hash table (essentially a HashMap instance). The article delves into the features, declaration, and examples of using HashSet in Java.

3. **W3Schools**:
   - **Description**: W3Schools offers a tutorial on Java's HashSet. It covers the basics of HashSet, including its declaration, adding items, checking for item existence, removing items, and iterating through a HashSet.

These links should give you a solid understanding of the concept and implementation of HashSet.

3. **Two Pointers**:
    - The `left` and `right` pointers are used to represent the start and end of the current window (substring). 
    - The two pointers move through the string, with the `right` pointer always moving forward and the `left` pointer moving forward when a repeating character is encountered.

By combining these concepts, the solution efficiently finds the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string. The sliding window ensures that each character is processed only once, leading to a linear time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
